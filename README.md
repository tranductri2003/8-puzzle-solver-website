This is a pet project developed during my learning journey. It's an 8 Puzzle Solver implemented using the A* algorithm. The web-based version of the solver is hosted at [http://8puzzlesolver.lqdlover.id.vn:8502/](http://8puzzlesolver.lqdlover.id.vn:8502/).

## Overview

This project is a web-based implementation of the classic 8 Puzzle game solver. The solver uses the A* algorithm to find the optimal solution for the puzzle.

## Features

- **Interactive Solver**: Solve the 8 Puzzle interactively using the A* algorithm.
- **Responsive Design**: The web interface is responsive and adapts well to different screen sizes.

## Usage

To solve the puzzle, simply visit [http://8puzzlesolver.lqdlover.id.vn:8502/](http://8puzzlesolver.lqdlover.id.vn:8502/) in your web browser. Enter the initial and target matrix sequences, then click "Solve" to find the solution using the A* algorithm.
